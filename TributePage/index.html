          Kobe Bean Bryant was an American professional basketball player. A
          shooting guard, he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los
          Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely
          regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, Bryant
          won five NBA championships, was an 18-time All-Star, a 15-time member
          of the All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the
          2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP.
          Bryant also led the NBA in scoring twice, and ranks fourth in league
          all-time regular season and postseason scoring.
